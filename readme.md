This is the code for controlling an LED matrix usign the DMA on an STM32F103. It will probably work with minor adjustments on any STM32 microcontroller, provided you setup the project using stm32cubemx in the same way as done for these projects.
Projects have been generated using stm32cubemx and developed with the OpenSTM32 IDE. All code is LGPL licensed unless stated otherwise in the file.
